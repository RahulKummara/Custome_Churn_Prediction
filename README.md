# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Definition
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

The Customer Churn Prediction contains information of all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022

Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!

The Zip Code Population table contains complimentary information on the estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table

## Objectives
- Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.

- Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn

- Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.

## Skills

> Python Libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matlplotlib, seaborn

> Data Visualization

> Data Analysis

> Machine Learning

## Application

The ability to predict churn before it happens allows businesses to take proactive actions to keep existing customers from churning. This could look like: 
```
  Customer success teams reaching out to those high-risk customers to provide support or to gauge 
  what needs may not be being met.
```

The advantage of calculating a company's churn rate is that it provides clarity on how well the business is retaining customers, which is a reflection on the quality of the service the business is providing, as well as its usefulness.
